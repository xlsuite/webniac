Webniac = Someone crazy about the web.
### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. Webniac is a lifestyle choice.

1. We're born this way.

1. We like to experiment. (Don't knock it unless you've tried it.) [Webniac](http://mediastewardship.com)

### Quick Start

```sh
# if you don't have ember-cli installed already
npm install -g ember-cli

ember new super-blog
cd super-blog

ember install ember-ghost ember-ghost-casper-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [editing files with Ember Ghost](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
